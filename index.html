    <p>Hey everyone!</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>I'm Jezreel Franco and I'm majoring in Data Science!</p>
    <p>Some hobbies I enjoy include; arts and crafts, reading, cooking, and traveling!!<p>
    <p>I've grown up as a member of the church and one of my favorite scripture is D&C: 68:6: </p>
    <p> "Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I cwas, that I am, and that I am to come."</p>
